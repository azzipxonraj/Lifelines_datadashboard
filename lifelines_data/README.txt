The Lifelines dataset that you may use for your assignment is a synthetic version of the actual data.
This means that the data is not exactly the same as the actual data, but is statistically comparable.
Keep in mind that it still contains sensitive data that should only be used within
the context of this assignment. We therefore ask you to only use this data
for this assignment and to delete the data as soon as you have completed your assignment. 
If youâ€™re interested in using our data for your research, you are of course more than
welcome and you can let us know via our website:
